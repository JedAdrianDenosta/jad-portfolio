                  <p>
                    üñãÔ∏è I graduated Magna Cum Laude from{" "}
                    <b>West Visayas State University</b> with a degree in
                    Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence. As a
                    UI/UX Designer by profession and passion, I focus on
                    transforming problems into effective design solutions.

                  <p>
                    üé® For me, design is essential to any successful project and
                    plays a critical role in shaping companies. Designers serve
                    as a bridge between business goals and technical execution,
                    fostering collaboration through thoughtful and strategic
                    thinking.

                  <p>
                    üî• My passion for UI/UX design began during my first
                    hackathon, where I was inspired by industry leaders who
                    emphasized the importance of design. This led to the
                    creation of my case study, HospiLink, which allowed me to
                    apply design thinking to real-world problems.

                  {/* <p>
                    üè• HospiLink became my most successful project, recognized
                    as the Best Thesis for Computer Science by WVSU‚Äôs Computer
                    Science Department. It was also presented to university
                    leadership and earned a spot in the Top 10 of the Philippine
                    Startup Challenge-7.
